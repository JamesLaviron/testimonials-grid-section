## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- BEM methodology
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS mixins
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- CSS Logical properties
- Reset file

### What I learned

I learned how to work with mixins in order to easily use them inside my code. I learned how and when to create modifiers.

### Continued development

I now want to know how to work properly with framework and improve my speed. I also would like to understand more BEM needs. I would love if you give feedbacks on the way I used BEm here both for modifiers and file tree.
