        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
        current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got
        every penny’s worth.

          &#x201C; I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
          I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
          had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
          and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
          12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
          completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as
          a Software Engineer at a VR startup.&#x201D;

          &#x201C;Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
          code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
          The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
          hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
          next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
          often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
          developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!&#x201D;

        Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
        Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.

          &#x201C;The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I
          find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary
          to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
          junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
          personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and
          amazing people.&#x201D;
